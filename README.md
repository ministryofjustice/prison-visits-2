# Visit someone in prison

This is a spike on a full rewrite from the ground up, using a database instead
of serialised data in URLs in emails.

## Notes on models

### Slots

#### `RecurringSlot`

Represents a time period with begin and end hours and minutes. It does not have
a day or date.

#### `ConcreteSlot`

The expression of a slot on a particular day: this is a unique time that can be
booked.

#### `DayOfWeek`

This is a convenient set of singletons to represent the days of the week as
abstract concepts, separate from a particular date. They are used when
parsing the slot details into recurring and concrete slots.

### Steps

These models are not persisted but have attributes (via Virtus) and validations
to represent each step in the journey of requesting a visit.

#### `PrisonerStep`

The first step: information about the prisoner, including the prison.

#### `VisitorsStep`

The second step: information about the primary visitor and any additional
visitors.

#### `SlotsStep`

The third step: allows selection of slots for the prison.

#### `ConfirmationStep`

This step has only one attribute (`confirmed`) and exists only to facilitate
displaying a confirmation page in the same way as the preceding steps.

### Database tables

#### `Prison`

One record per prison, where a prison is a unique visitable location. That is,
where there are separate booking teams for different wings, those will appear
as distinct records.

Details about slots are stored as a JSON object, with the following structure:

```json
{
  "recurring": {
    "mon": ["1400-1610"],
    "tue": ["0900-1000", "1400-1610"]
  },
  "anomalous": {
    "2014-12-24": ["1400-1600"],
    "2014-12-31": ["1400-1600"]
  },
  "unbookable": ["2014-12-25", "2014-12-26"]
}
```

No slots will be listed for `unbookable` days. For `anomalous` days, the slots
are exactly those given in that section. For all other days, the available
slots are determined by the recurring weekly pattern.

#### `Visit`

This is the main table in the application, and contains all the essential data
for a visit: the prison, prisoner details, and primary visitor's details and
contact information.

#### `AdditionalVisitor`

These reference a `Visit` and are separated because:

* There may be zero or many of them.
* They have different (i.e. less) information than the primary visitor.

## The visit request process

The `StepsController` has only two actions, `index` and `create`, which means
only one path, differentiated by `GET` or `POST`. It is completely stateless:
progression through the steps is determined by the availability of complete
information in the preceding steps, passed either as user-completed form fields
or (in the case of preceding steps) as hidden fields.

The logic of processing steps and determining which step has been reached is
handled by the `StepsProcessor` class.

On an initial `GET`, the first step (`PrisonerStep`) is instantiated with no
parameters.

Thereafter, on a `POST` request, each step in turn is instantiated using the
named parameters for that step (if available). The first incomplete step (where
incompleteness is determined by the complete absence of parameters for that
step, or by the invalidity of those supplied) determines the template to be
rendered.

Finally, if all steps are complete, a `Visit` is created by
`BookingRequestCreator` and the `completed` template is rendered.

## Configuration

### Development

Emails will be sent to [MailCatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/), if it's running.
See its website for instructions.

## Environment variables used by the application

### Start Page

On production, we set this to [https://www.gov.uk/prison-visits](https://www.gov.uk/prison-visits) because that's the official start page for the service, but you can configure a different one.
