      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="bold-small"><a name="question2"></a>Are you interested in trying the online service? I can talk you through it so that you can use it on your own next time. It only takes a few minutes and then I'll be able to confirm your booking while we're on the phone.</span></p>

              </li>
