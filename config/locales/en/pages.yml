        leave a computer unprotected while in the process of making a prison
        visit request.

        We make every effort to check and test this service whenever we amend or

        We work hard to ensure that information within this prison visit request
        service is accurate. However, we can’t guarantee the accuracy and
        completeness of any information at all times.

        While we make every effort to ensure this service is accessible at all

        ### How we use your information

        The Ministry of Justice (HM Prison Service) uses and retains the
        personal data of visitors for the purposes of the safe and secure
        provision of Prison Services, including those related to the management
        and rehabilitation of offenders.

        Access to the establishment can only be granted by supplying the
        prescribed information in order to ensure and maintain a safe and secure
        environment for all.

        You have the right to request details as to the personal information we
        hold for you; and subsequently request that we correct any personal
        information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date. We will not
        share your information with other organisations unless it is required
        for the purposes of prevention, detection of crime, apprehension,
        prosecution, and management of offenders; prevention of terrorism;
        national security; or required to do by law.

        Separately from the information entered by those using this service, we
        also collect site-usage information which allows us to see how the
        service is being used in order to allow us to improve it. This
        information does not contain any personal data.

        It includes:

        -   questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email
            address if you send a message via feedback
        -   your IP address, and details of which version of web browser you
            used
        -   information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging
            techniques to help us improve the website

        This helps us to:

        -   improve the site by monitoring how you use it
        -   respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to
        -   provide you with information about local services if you want it

        We can’t personally identify you using your data.

        ### Where your data is stored

        We store your data on our secure servers in the UK. However, it may also
        be stored outside of Europe, where it could be viewed by our staff or
        suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this.

        We also use other suppliers to provide this service:

        -   [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) to relay information to prisons. See
            the [terms & conditions](http://sendgrid.com/tos) attached to

            this service.

        ### Keeping your data secure

        Transmitting information over the internet is generally not completely
        secure, and we can’t guarantee the security of your data. We do however
        use SSL in order to encrypt all data transferred to and received from
        our server.

        We take data security very seriously and we take every step to ensure
        that your data remains private and secure.

        ### Any data you transmit is at your own risk.

        We have procedures and security features in place to try and keep your
        data secure once we receive it.

        We won’t share your information with any other organisations for
        marketing, market research or commercial purposes, and we don’t pass on
        your details to other websites.

        ### Disclosing your information

        We may pass on your personal information if we have a legal obligation
        to do so.

        ### How we manage sessions

        This service can be used to make a prison visit request. Your session is
        active for 20 minutes even if you close your browser, or navigate away
        from this service. During this time, personal information about you may
        be visible to anyone with access to your computer.

        Your data is held in memory during the duration of the session; this is
        cleared after 20 minutes of inactivity.
